# turn-qa
## Juan Manuel Perez Garate juanperezgarate@gmail.com

### This test automation suite was created using Cypress with javascript, and also in order to complete the Turn QA Home Task.
### You only need to clone the project preferably using Visual Studio Code and follow the next steps:

#### Open the file fixtures/candidate.json and edit the values, these values are the candidate´s information.
#### This test suite takes the values of the candidate.json and based on it, it is created and downloaded as the test steps shared with me mention.

### Install dependencies
> npm init
> npm yarn

### Installation of Cypress
> npm install cypress --save-dev

### Runing the application: 
everything is configured, you only need to execute the following command.
> npm test

### Allure Reports
After to finilize the test execution, the application is gonna open the allure report page on the browser, you don´t need to do some else. ¡Yes, that´s amazing!
